Beatblocks
==========

A rhythm generator and beatbox patch for [Patchblocks](http://patchblocks.com). Sets the tempo with a synthesized hi-hat. The operator can improvise a rhythm over the top with basic kick drum and snare sounds.

Tempo is variable from 40 to 240bpm. Avaiable time signatures are 2:4, 3:4, 4:4, 4:8, 6:8, 4:12 (I thinkâ€¦).

Controls
--------
Left Knob: Set tempo  
Right Knob: Select time signature  
Left Button: Kick drum  
Right Button: Snare drum

Left LED indicates tempo.
Right LED indicates hi-hat speed.
